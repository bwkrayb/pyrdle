Welcome to my wordle clone!

I wanted to write this because I was bored. Threw it together in a couple hours.

To start a game, type python3 play.py.


Welcome to pyrdle!
To play:
Guess a 5 letter word. If a character matches
in the exact spot, there will be an X under that 
character. If character is in the random word, but
not in that particular spot, there will be an / under
that character. If the letter does not match at
all, there will be nothing.


A prereq for making this project work if you take this is downloading both enchant(from your package manager) and pyenchant(using pip). These download a dictionary and are used for checking if the random assortment of letters is a real word.
